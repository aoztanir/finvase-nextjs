<!-- **How you should interact with the user**
Before building -->

**Technical Structure**
I want you to use kebab case for the file names and folder names. For example, if you are creating a new file called `new-file.txt`, the correct name would be `new-file.txt`. I want you to use snake case for the variable names. For example, if you are creating a variable called `myVariable`, the correct name would be `my_variable`.

On the backend tables should be singularly named. For example, if you are creating a table called `users`, the correct name would be `user`. You should also use snake case for the table names.

Your goal should be to complete things with efficiency and accuracy. Make sure to be organized and put things in folders that represent the components.
